# Either 

Either is one of those types that you already know in Swift but it's specialized in some values. 

Here is it:

```swift
enum Either<Left, Right> {
    case left(Left)
    case right(Right)
}
```

Slo it's an enum with two cases. That should ring at least two bells. Usually the `right` one is associated with the `good` or `success` or `dextra`. The `left` on the other hand is for `bad`, `failure`, `error` or you can say `sinistra`.

At least two types that are common in Swift are a specialization of this `Either`. 

You can take a look at _Optional_ and match `left` with _none_ case. Also you can take a look at _Result_ and match if _failure_ with a `left` case.

So here you have a more generic type that you can use. It's useful not only when you have to validate stuff. But also when there is a need to return different types.

## Computed Properties

To make life a bit easier there are defined some helper properties. 

Handy properties for logic checks. 

```swift
var isLeft : Bool // true if `left` case
var isRight: Bool // true if `right` case
```

When you want to get to a value but you can deal with optional.

```swift
var right: Right?
var left : Left?
```

Take a look at [OptionalAPI](https://github.com/sloik/OptionalAPI) to see how working with Optional can be a pleasure.

## `map`s

```swift
func map<R>(_ transform: (Right) -> R) -> Either<Left,R>
```

It's a function that takes a function expecting an instance of `Right` and produces a new instance of `Either<Left, R>`. Type `R` means `NewRight` but is abbreviated.

Either treats it's right value a bit specially. This is analogous how Result and Optional treat some of their own cases. 

That means that if you want to `map` an `Either` then by default you will be given an instance of a `Right` type.

So if you have:
```swift
func increment(_ i: Int) -> Int { i + 1 }

let right = Either<String,Int>.right(42)

right
    .map(increment) // .right(43)
```

Final result is a new instance of `Either<String,Int>` with it's `right` case holding `43`. Same thing with _left_ would do nothing.

```swift
let left = Either<String,Int>.left("I'm left")

left
    .map(increment) //  .left("I'm left")
```

### `rightMap`

```swift
func mapRight<R>(_ transform: (Right) -> R) -> Either<Left, R>
```

You can be explicit about it and call `rightMap` that is just a wrapper around `map`.

### `leftMap`

```swift
func mapLeft<L>(_ transform: (Left) -> L) -> Either<L, Right>
```

However if you want to transform a `left` value you can use `leftMap`.  Same story as for right but for left.

```swift
left
    .map({ $0.uppercased() }) // .left("I'M LEFT")
```

### `biMap`

```swift
func biMap<L,R>( _  leftTransform:  (Left) -> L,
                 _ rightTransform: (Right) -> R)
     -> Either<L, R>
```

This function takes two other functions as arguments. Left is the _left transform_ and the right is the _right transform_. This results in a new instance of `Either<L,R>`.

This one is a `map` that combines `leftMap` and `rightMap`. More common name for it is `biMap` but I would like it be handy in the IDE and you can start typing just _map_ and see what's there.

This `biMap` can be used when you want to combine those transformations in to one statement:

```swift
right
    .biMap({ $0.uppercased() }, increment) // .right(43)

left
    .biMap({ $0.uppercased() }, increment) // .left("I'M LEFT")
```

## `flatMaps`

Same as map above, but with one difference. 

```swift
func flatMap<R>(
    _ transform: (Right) -> Either<Left, R> 
    ) -> Either<Left, R>

func flatMapLeft<L>(
    _ transform: (Left) -> Either<L, Right>
    ) -> Either<L, Right>
```

This time a transform function returns another Either. This wold result in an **Either Either** like `Either<Left, Either<Left, R>>`. So using this flatMap (or another name you can fins `bind`) you can remove one layer of nesting.

Just as a side note, whenever you are using `flatMap` you are doing the dreaded **monadic computation**. You were calling `flatMap` on optionals and it was fine. And yes Optional is a `Monad`. If you want you can Google it just don't overthink it and you will be just fine üòé

# Utils

## `either`

```swift
func either<L,R,T>(
    _  leftTransform: @escaping (L) -> T,
    _ rightTransform: @escaping (R) -> T) -> (Either<L,R>) -> T
```

This might not be so common, but it's a function that returns another function. The way it works you start with providing two functions. Left transform knows kow to produce `T` given an `L`. Right transform knows kow to produce `T` given an `R`. 

Next step is the returned function. This one expects and `Either<L,R>` and when you provide an instance of this either then it will produce and instance of `T`. 

## `lefts`

```swift
func lefts<L,R>(_ eithers: [Either<L,R>] ) -> [L]
```

I guess type says it all. Give this function an array of either-s and in return you will get an array of `L`s.

## `rights`

```swift
func rights<L,R>(_ eithers: [Either<L,R>] ) -> [R]
```

I guess type says it all. Give this function an array of either-s and in return you will get an array of `R`s.

## `partitionEithers`

Returns a tuple containing all `L` values in the `left`/first array. And all the `R` in the `right`/ second array.

```swift
let eithers: [Either<String,Int>] = 
    [ .left("A"), 
      .right(42), 
      .left("B"), 
      .right(24) ]

let (lefts, rights) = partitionEithers(eithers)

lefts  // ["A", "B"]
rights // [42, 24]
```
